Sometimes your deep into a debug session and want to save
your spot. Well its very annoying having to restart the 
debugger just to read info that you already dumped before. 

I decided to create a !save command.

This command allows you to dump crtical process data into a 
file named out.slp. This file has a custom format and must be 
walk with "slpWalker.c".

cl slpWalker.c

Usage: slpWalker.exe out.slp

This .slp file contains Imports, Modules, function data, and disasm.

Keep in mind, This only stores assembly instructions that you have already 
dumped in Glyph. This data being saved to the file is basically a copy of
important information from your session.
