Stack Trace:
============

Commands: !Inject, !dump

Dll: stackWalk.dll

You may be in a position where you want to
know the last few functions that have been 
called in a process. Most people would say,
well how would you do that if the functions
have already been called? Well, thats where
something called stack unwinding comes in
handy.

I have been working on a custom version of
the stackWalk.dll that doesnt use
RtlLookupFunctionEntry or RtlVirtualUnwind
but this one does use those to get the job
done.

To perform a stack trace simple run !Inject,
make sure you have a Injector ready or the 
provided one, and inject the stackWalk.dll.

After getting the past few RIP addresses, 
use the !dump command to disasm the function 
and see what was actually ran.
